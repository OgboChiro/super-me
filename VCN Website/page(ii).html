<p style="font-family:Lucida Calligraphy; font-size:16px;">
The VFC-Narios are majorly short (spoken-word) poems which are seldom about people’s 
experiences with rather valuable lessons to learn and sustain from each one.

<h3 style="font-family:Comic sans ms; color:white;"><b><em>How was VCN formed?</em></b><h3>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Calligraphy; font-size:16px">
The VFC Narios was founded by Chimfeka Ogbo on the 26th of August 2016. The VFC-Narios was originally 
inspired by a spoken-word poetry performance that took place in Victoria Fellowship Church (VFC).
Afterwards, it was plain to see that the audience enjoyed it. 
I also realized that the chances of such happening again were very slim and that with poetic means, 
crucial and stirring messages could be conveyed. 
Not only could that happen, but in video form it could be available frequently and to a larger audience.

<h3 style="font-family:Comic sans ms; color:white;"><b><em>Our Mission?</em></b><h3>

<p style="font-family:Lucida Calligraphy; font-size:16px;">
The VFC-Narios is for strengthening the faith of Christians everywhere, 
and like the VFC mission, <em>to bring everyone to the saving knowledge of Christ</em>, 
and through them, make the gospel known to the rest of the world. 
The fact that these form the purpose of the VFC-Narios does not mean that these 
are the only effects viewers would experience however.
